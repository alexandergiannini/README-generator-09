# Professional README Generator by Alexander Giannini

# Hello there! This project is a README Generator! Using NODE.js, a user is able to input the command "node index.js" within the terminal, then receives a series of questions. The questions include project details, installation instructions, what license your project is under, and more! After completing those questions successfully, a README is generated for you! Hope you enjoy!

# You can see a sample README generated by this project on the READMEsample.md file within this repository!
